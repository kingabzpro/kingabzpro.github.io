# a summary about you
summary: I am Technology Manager turned Data Scientist, who loves building machine learning models and Ai Products. Recently, I have trained the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model on the Wolof language to help illiterate people interact with apps with just their voice, in a language they can already speak. I am currently testing Ai Products at PEC-PITC, which later get approved for human trials, eg: Breast Cancer Classifier. My vision is to build an Ai product that will help identify students that are struggling with mental illness. Do check my [Data Science Portfolio](https://deepnote.com/@abid).
